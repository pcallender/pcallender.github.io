I'm an experienced T-shaped software developer, primarily working for the last 7 years as a Java expert. I firmly believe in using computing as a social good to improve outcomes for people around the world.

I have particular deep knowledge of the following technologies
 - Java (JDK 8 - 11)
 - Java Swing
 - JavaScript and TypeScript
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - SQL (in particular, T-SQL)

and a broader familiarity with
 - Objective-C/Swift
 - UIKit
 - Android SDK
 - Node.js with Express.js
 - Windows Server administration
 - IP networking

I am comfortable working in technology stacks that I do not have prior experience with.
