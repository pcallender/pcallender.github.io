I am an orchestrator and arranger of musical works, primarily for musical theatre. I typically work with [Gang Shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_Show), and I take pride in providing the best possible score to accompany the performers.

I also enjoy playing keyboards in orchestra pits, and have a deep understanding of MainStage programming.
